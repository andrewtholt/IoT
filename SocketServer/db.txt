Two 'types' of sqlite database.

1.  Global, holds settings and is RO to clients.

2.  Client, possibly in RAM, on disk to begin with in a file called 
    <nodeName>.db.  Holds maps of clients short name to MQTT path for publish
    and subscribe paths.  Can also hold MQTT server details if we want per 
    client settings.  Check this first, and on fail check global.

Write loader.  Load setup for a client from a file.
Usage: load -n <client name> -f <filename>

Basically connects as <client name> and loads a series of commands 
from the file.

If client is already connected then exit.

Q: Should lock be in the database, against each client ?

Detect client disconnect and clean up.


I need to get the network socket into the message callback, somehow.
